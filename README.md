# VkEngine
Welcome to VkEngine, a modern and efficient Vulkan-based rendering engine. This project is used to learn GPU optimisation techniques and different methods of rendering.
The render is developed using C++20. And tested using a GTX 1080ti and Apple M1 GPUs.

To have code as clean as possible the code is compiled on 3 compiler.
- GCC
- MSVC
- CLANG
  
This provide compile time warnings to further enhance the code.
